A blessing in disguise
A dime a dozen
Beat around the bush
Benefit of the doubt
Better late than never
Bite the bullet
Boom goes the dynamite
Break a leg
Burning bridges
Call it a day
Cutting corners
Easy does it
Get your act together
Go back to the drawing board
Hang in there
Hit the sack
No pain no gain
On the ball
Pull yourself together
Push it real good
So far so good
Speak of the devil
The best of both worlds
Under the weather
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
A penny for your thoughts
Actions speak louder than words
Insult to injury
Barking up the wrong tree
Birds of a feather flock together
Bite off more than you can chew
Break the ice
By the skin of your teeth
Comparing apples to oranges
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
Cold shoulder
Hit the nail on the head
Kill two birds with one stone
Let the cat out of the bag
Once in a blue moon
On thin ice
Slow and steady wins the race
Spill the beans
Rain check
Take it with a grain of salt
The early bird gets the worm
Throw caution to the wind
Method to the madness
The whole nine yards
The best thing since sliced bread
